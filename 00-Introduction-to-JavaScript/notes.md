## What is JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a widely-used programming language created by Brendan Eich in just ten days in 1995.

## Java vs. JavaScript

When JavaScript was initially released in 1995 as well, it was under the name Mocha. It was later renamed to LiveScript and then to JavaScript.

The name 'JavaScript' was chosen to capitalize on Java's growing popularity in the programming community, since Java was developed first in 1995 and quickly became quite popular.

JavaScript follows a standard named ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES).

ECMAScript is the official standard that defines the JavaScript language. The latest version of this standard is ECMAScript 2023.

## The first program

Programs written in this language are called scripts.

```javascript
console.log("I am starting to learn JavaScript!");
```

To open browser console `Ctrl+Shift+J` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux, or `Cmd+Option+J` or Cmd+Option+I on Mac.
